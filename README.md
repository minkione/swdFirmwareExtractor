# swdFirmwareExtractor

The original research: https://www.aisec.fraunhofer.de/en/FirmwareProtection.html

this repositry is a fork of @sergachev. It contains a port of the original firmware extractor code to STM32F103x (bluepill).

Status : build ok but extractor not working.
To be tested with a bluepill reading STM32F07 target.
